price: 35.0
name: RASPBERRY PI 4 MODEL B - 2 GB RAM
description: |-
  The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is the newest Raspberry Pi computer made, and the Pi Foundation knows you can always make a good thing better! And what could make the Pi 4 better than the 3? How about a faster processor, USB 3.0 ports, and updated Gigabit Ethernet chip with PoE capability? Good guess - that's exactly what they did!

  The Raspberry Pi 4 is the latest product in the Raspberry Pi range, boasting an updated 64-bit quad core processor running at 1.5GHz with built-in metal heatsink, USB 3 ports, dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless LAN, faster Gigabit Ethernet, and PoE capability via a separate PoE HAT.

  This version comes with 2GB of RAM, but we also have versions with 1 and 4 GB if you like.

  You can still use all your favorite Raspbian or PIXEL software with this update. You MUST make sure to upgrade your Raspbian operating system install to the latest version so that the firmware can support the new chips! Old SD cards from previous releases will not work without a upgrade!

  The dual-band wireless LAN comes with modular compliance certification, that's the metal tin in the corner of the Pi, with the logo stamped on it. This allows the board to be designed into end products with significantly reduced wireless LAN compliance testing, improving both cost and time to market.

  Please note, the Pi 4 is a significant redesign and Raspberry Pi 1/2/3 cases and power supplies will not fit!

  Official Raspberry Pi 4 case - easy snap-fit case for your Pi 4
  Official Raspberry Pi 4 power supply - can give up to 3A (15W) of current with a 1.5m long cable, and a USB C connector
  Micro HDMI cable - connect the onboard micro HDMI sockets to standard HDMI displays.
